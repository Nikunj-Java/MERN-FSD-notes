How to work with JS?
--------------------
- we can write scripting code in <script></script> tag or we can create Separate file for that.
- we can include that external file in our HTML file.
- wenever HTML loads in a browser, JS file also loaded along with it
- All browsers supports javascript
----------------------------------

How To Add JAVASCRIPT?
-----------------------

	1. Internal Javascript
	-----------------------
	<script>//you can write your code</script>
	[Note: You can Add anywhere either in Head tag or in Body tag
		but Standard Practice that we do is always we add in Body tag]


	2. External JavaScript
	----------------------
	- create separate file and write script code. include the script in HTML file
	- The Separate file must be saved with Extenstion .js and include that in your HTML using Below Syntax
	- <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript" lang="javascript"></script>


***************************************************************************************************************
VARIABLES IN JAVASCRIPT
***************************************************************************************************************

- JavaScript is not a Strict language like java
- Variable are used to store the values ( Temporary Storage )
- Vlaue can be anything Name, number, address, some result etc...,

so how to declare a variable?
---------------------------------
- use 'var' keyword to declare any data type
Eg:
	var name;
	var num1,num2;
	var address;
	var phone;

How to give Values to the variable?
-----------------------------------

	var name="Nikunj Soni";
	var num1=20;
	var address="Mumbai";
	var phone="9876543210";
[Note: text values must be declared with single qoute or double qoute]


What is the Naming Convension of Variable?
-------------------------------------------
1. Give Meaningful name don't give name like a,b,c....
2. variable name must start with letter and after that u can use digit or special characters
	a1,b1,a2,b2 ------>Valid
3. variable name can't start with  number
	1a,1b,2a,2b ------> Not Valid
4. Varibale are case Sensitive means if you will wirte Name & name are different variable not the same.

How to Print Value in Browser?
------------------------------------------
syntax:
	document.write(value);

How to print Value in Console?
------------------------------------------
	console.log(value)


***************************************************************************************************************
Operators in JavaScript
***************************************************************************************************************

1. ARITHMATIC OPERATORS:
--------------------------
	+(addition)
	-(subtraction)
	*(multiplication)
	/(division)
	%(modulus)--->return u the reminder    5/3==>Remainder=2

2. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:
---------------------------

	assignment is the operator used to assign a value
	= operator is used to assign a value
	Eg:

	a=10;  //10 value stored in a
	b=a //value stored in b from a

	res= num1+num2; //means it will store the resultant value in res variable


	___________________________________________
	Example:1
	
	var result;   // variable declaration
	result=67;   // assigning a value to the declared variable

	var result=67;   // Combination of Declaration + Assignment

We need to understand some sorthand assignement operator
---------------------------------------------------------

	num = num + 3; =====> num +=3;
	num = num * 5; =====> num *=5;
	num1 = num1 /num2 ===> num1/=num2


3. COMPARISON OPERATORS:(Relational Operator)
--------------------------------------------------------
	==  (check where the numbers or the values are same or not)
	!=  (not equal)
	<   (less than)
	<=  (less than equlas)
	>   (greater than)
	>=  (greater than equals)
	=== (compare the value with its type)
	!== (not equal with value type)
	?:  (ternary operator)
	

4. LOGICAL OPERATORS:

5. INCREMENTAL AND DECREMENTAL OPRATORS
